If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Name two big differences between display: block; and display: inline;.

-display: block means that the element is displayed as a block, as paragraphs and headers have always been. A block has some whitespace above and below it and tolerates no HTML elements next to it, except when ordered otherwise (by adding a float declaration to another element, for instance).
-display: inline means that the element is displayed inline, inside the current block on the same line. Only when it's between two blocks does the element form an 'anonymous block', that however has the smallest possible width.
-The 2 difference would be display: inline doesn't have white space around it. Display block will have the next item next to each other.
